# BridgeBuilder v1.0.0
BridgeBuilder automatically builds a bridge under you as you walk. This can be useful when traversing caverns, building across rough terrain or when playing in a map where not falling is imperative. This mod is meant to enhance gameplay, NOT offer an unfair advantage.

## Usage
The key to toggle BridgeBuilder is B. Note that the mod will disable if you don't have any more building blocks in your hotbar, and
if you switch to a non-building block item.

## Is this a virus?
No. Feel free to browse the source code yourself to see how it works.

## Will this get me banned?
Probably not. Whilst designing this mod, I made sure that it emulated real human interactions. I have tested this mod on GCheat and NoCheatPlus and have not been flagged/banned. However, it may be possible that the administrators of a server desire you not to use this on their server, so please respect their wishes.
